```bash
pip install openai[datalib]
```


```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```


```bash
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data.jsonl
```


```bash
Analyzing...

- Your file contains 12 prompt-completion pairs. In general, we recommend having at least a few hundred examples. We've found that performance tends to linearly increase for every doubling of the number of examples
- All prompts end with suffix `->`
- All completions end with suffix `\n`

No remediations found.

You can use your file for fine-tuning:
> openai api fine_tunes.create -t "data.jsonl"

After youâ€™ve fine-tuned a model, remember that your prompt has to end with the indicator string `->` for the model to start generating completions, rather than continuing with the prompt. Make sure to include `stop=["\n"]` so that the generated texts ends at the expected place.
Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 2.61 minutes to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`. Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
